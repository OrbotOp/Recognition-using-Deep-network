#### Task_1

To download the MNIST dataset into the "../data" folder, train the model, and save the results into the "task_1/results" folder, run "python training_model.py" command. To make predictions on the first example in the test dataset and the new input in test_digits, run "python predict_model.py" command.

#### Task_2

Execute the command python examine.py to produce the initial layer plots and generate a truncated model at the same time.

#### Task_3

execute the command python embedding.py to create the CSV files, display the sum of squared differences result, and make predictions on the new input within the test_greek folder.

#### Task_4

due to lot of computation power we have implimented this task in google colab.

#### Extensions

we have done two extensions and both .py files are kept in a same folder. to execute just run the python file
